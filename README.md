# Data-Cleaning-in-Python
I processsed a data set that contained customer information. The data set was in a raw and unstructured format, and it needed to be cleaned and organized before it could be used by the customer service team.

I used Jupyter Notebook as my tool of choice for this project, as it allowed me to write and execute Python code interactively and document my steps along the way. I imported the data set into a pandas 
DataFrame and performed various data cleaning operations, such as:

Removing duplicate, missing, or irrelevant records
Renaming and reordering columns
Converting data types and formats
Handling outliers and errors
Normalizing and standardizing values
Splitting and merging columns
